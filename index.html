        <h5>You don't need to cling to your accomplishments.<br>
            Everything you did before was just practice. It's<br> 
            already used up. It'll never grow beyond what it<br> 
            already is. It's static. It doesn't define you. The<br> 
            best you ever did is holding you back. Let go of<br>
            the past. You create the future. Everything you<br>
            need is right inside of you. You choose how to<br>
            use it. You're always getting better. You're never<br>
            the same. You're dynamic. The best you'll ever<br>
            do is still out there ahead of you, waiting for you<br>
            to catch up.
